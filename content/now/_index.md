---

This page is inspired by [the Now Movement](https://sive.rs/nowff) which I saw on [Pauline Narvas's](https://www.paulinenarvas.com/now) website. Learn about what I'm up to right now.

## Where

- I am currently based in Kitchener, ON Canada.
- But I usually travel to various US stater during the year for tech events and conferences.
- I will be visiting my home country India pretty soon.

## Work

I recently completed my 2 years at Twilio as a Developer Evangelist. This is my first [devrel](https://www.whatisdevrel.com/) role.

- I am currently exploring different ways to incorporate AI into communication solutions.
- Also have some passion project that I am making some progress on like [Learn to Cloud](https://learntocloud.guide/) and [the Cloud Resume API Challenge](https://cloudresumeapi.dev/).
- Shipping more cloud and devops related content on [my YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@rishabincloud)!

## Health

- I have been trying to gain some muscle and strength, it's been around 4+ months since I started lifting consistently.
- Also, found a new passion for running, ran [my first race](https://www.instagram.com/p/C5gKHjFAuZD/?img_index=1): 5kms back in March.
- Volleyball league is ongoing as usual, we finished 2nd in the last season.
