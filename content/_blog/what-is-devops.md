## What Is DevOps? What does a DevOps Engineer do?

Hello Friends üëãüèæ
It's been a while that I wrote a blog, but starting 2022 strong, here is the first one for this year!

So as some of you may know I have been working as a DevOps Engineer for almost a year now, and I am often asked, what is DevOps? and what does a DevOps Engineer do?

## DevOps Engineer

A DevOps engineer introduces processes, tools, and methodologies to balance needs throughout the software development life cycle, from coding and deployment, to maintenance and updates.

DevOps engineers reduce that complexity, closing the gap between actions needed to quickly change an application, and the tasks that maintain its reliability.

## What is DevOps?

DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization‚Äôs ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes. This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market.

So you might ask, how did was DevOps formed?

Right from the Start, software development comprised two different departments. The development team that develops the plan, designs and builds the system from scratch and the operation team for testing and implementation of whatever is developed. The operations team gave the development team feedback on any bugs that needed fixing and any rework required. Invariably, the development team would be idle awaiting feedback from the operations team. This undoubtedly extended timelines and delayed the entire software development cycle. There would be instances where the development team moves on to the next project while the operations team continues to provide feedback for the previous code. This meant weeks or even months for the project to be closed and final code to be developed. Now, what if the two departments came together and worked in collaboration with each other?

What if the wall of confusion was broken and this is called the DevOps approach?
The DevOps symbol resembles an Infinity sign, suggesting that it is a continuous process of improving efficiency and constant activity.

The DevOps approach makes companies adapt faster to updates and development changes. The teams can now deliver quickly and the deployments are more consistent and smooth, though there may be communication challenges, DevOps manages a streamlined flow between the teams and makes the software development process successful.

So in simpler terms, DevOps is a set of practices to build, test and release your code in small, frequent steps.
