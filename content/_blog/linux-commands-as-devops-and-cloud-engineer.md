## Linux commands I use as a Cloud and DevOps Engineer

Hey Friends, as we know that I am a huge advocate of **Linux** and I think it is important aspect if you are entering **Cloud Computing** or **DevOps**.
I wanted to reflect back on some commonly used linux commands while my time as a Cloud and DevOps Engineer.

Here are the top 7 commands:

### `𝗹𝘀 command`

`ls` is probably the most typed command in the terminal.
it lists the content of a directory (current directory by default)

### `𝗰𝗱 command`

it refers to “change directory” meaning it switches to the directory you want.

### `𝗰𝗵𝗺𝗼𝗱 command`

It let's you change the permission of the file.
It has a lot of options, the most I used was `𝘤𝘩𝘮𝘰𝘥 +𝘹 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘦.𝘹` which added the execute flag.
Basic permissions:

- r (read)
- w (write)
- x (execute)

### `𝗵𝘁𝗼𝗽 command`

interactive process viewer that lets you manage your machine’s resources directly from the terminal.
note, it's not installed by default certain times.

### `𝗰𝗮𝘁 command`

 Stands for concatenate, lets you create, view, and concatenate files directly from the terminal.
I mostly used it to preview a file without opening text editor.

### `𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗹 command`

it's pretty similar to cat, but only print last 10 lines by default, but it can be changed by adding -n.
You can also have a live tail of log file running, that's what I used it for the most. It can be done by adding `-f` to the command - `tail -f filename`

### `𝗴𝗿𝗲𝗽 command`

I think grep is really powerful, when working with text files. It searches for lines that match a regular expression. This really helped navigating large log files.

So these are the commands that I feel I used the most on daily basis.
